This doctoral school trains PhD and Master students by covering most aspects of Solid Earth sciences, including seismology, mineralogy, geodynamics, geophysics and geochemistry. A field excursion is often proposed to link theoretical aspects to observations in the nearby Alps. This doctoral training welcomes students trained in geology, physics, chemistry, mathematics or computer science who are interested in the interior of the Earth.

This Doctoral Training is organized by:
