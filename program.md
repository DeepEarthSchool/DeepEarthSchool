<b> 10 years of seismological imaging in the Alps: from seismograms to geological interpretation </b>
</p>

Several temporary seismological experiments in the Alps (2012-2020) have provided a data set of unique spatial density and quality for a mountain range. They have advanced our knowledge of the lithospheric structure by combining different seismological imaging methods. The idea was to compare the various images to better understand their limits and better constrain interpretative geological models.

**Planetology** \| [Frédéric Schmidt](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=VpyZwlcAAAAJ&hl=fr), [Valérie Ciarletti](https://www.latmos.ipsl.fr/index.php/fr/43-pages-perso-officielles/3634-Valerie-Ciarletti-ici-latmos-ipsl-fr)
<p align="center">
<b> Valérie Ciarletti: Planets, Moons and small bodies: What lies beneath the surface ? What  does it tell us? 
 </b>
</p>

In planetary science, the access to the subsurface of bodies such as planets, moons, asteroids, comets allows to collect first-hand information, which is essential to properly document the current environment of these objects, reveal the processes that shaped them at different stages of their evolution and ultimately provide clues and constraints on the scenarios of formation of our solar system. 
A number of questions are still looking for answers or clues, sounding radars and ground penetrating radars can provide: Are there reservoirs of liquid water in the Martian deep subsurface?  Could lava tubes on the Moon be used as shelters in the frame of human exploration? How much water is trapped as ice in permanently shadowed craters on the Moon ? What is the internal structure of a comet nucleus?  What is the depth of the anticipated oceans beneath the icy shells of Ganymede and Europa ? What are the depths of hydrocarbon sees on Titan? What is the chronology of the geological processes that took place in a given site on Mars or on the Moon?

**Geodynamics** \| [Adina Pusok](https://www.earth.ox.ac.uk/people/adina-pusok/)

<p align="center">
<b>  Geodynamics: Mantle convection, Plates, Plumes and Melts
 </b>
</p>

This course covers the current state of knowledge of mantle convection and plate tectonics. A broad background to the physics of mantle convection will be provided by explaining what it is, how it works, and how to quantify it in simple terms. The course then explores how mantle convection is linked to plate tectonics, and investigates how the different views of plate tectonics can be reconciled with the currently available data. The role of magmatism within the context of plate tectonics is also examined. Simple theoretical and numerical models in geodynamics will be highlighted throughout the course.

**Gravimetry/Geodesy** \| [Cécile Doubre](https://ites.unistra.fr/recherche/equipes/da/da-perso/cecile-doubre), [Cédric Twardzik](https://cedtw.bitbucket.io/)

<p align="center">
<b> Cédric Twardzik & Cécile Doubre: The seismic cycle from observations to models
 </b>
</p>

How do we unlock the secrets of fault mechanics while we do not have direct access into the depths where the processes unfold? The answer relies on the use of indirect surface observations from which we can extract relevant information about how faults move under kilometers of rocks. Over the centuries, and as we have gathered more and more observations, we have discovered that faults undergo various stages of stress release and accumulation, in what is better known as the seismic cycle. In this series of lectures, we will guide you through each phase of this cycle - interseismic, preseismic, coseismic, and postseismic - and explain how we squeeze information from surface observations to gain valuable insights into the life of a fault.

**Seismology** \| [Paul Cupillard](https://georessources.univ-lorraine.fr/fr/content/cupillard), [Anne Paul](https://www.isterre.fr/annuaire/pages-web-du-personnel/anne-paul/)

<p align="center">
<b> Paul Cupillard: Characterizing earthquakes from seismic data
 </b>
</p>

We will see how Mathematics and Physics allow describing earthquakes in a quantitative way. Fundamental parameters such as moment tensor and magnitude will be introduced. The way these parameters act on seismic records will be studied as well. From there, various methods for characterizing earthquakes will be presented, including basic ones (based on first arrivals) and more advanced ones (based full waveforms).

**Field excursion** \| Thierry Dumont

</p>

The city of Barcelonnette is located in a tectonic “window” showing the Dauphiné sedimentary cover (blue) overlain and surrounded by the “Helminthoid flysch nappes” (orange) issued from the Ligurian Tethys ocean. Their basal contact is visible around the Col de Restefond, where nappe stacking and burial was preceded by deformation of the deep foreland basin floor and gravity driven emplacement of large size blocks sourced from the Briançonnais and Provençal domains. This place gives the opportunity to observe an early stage of propagation of the Alpine orogen (late Eocene), before the activation of the “Penninic thrust” and the radial propagation of the western Alps arc.
The trip will include one easy montain walk (max 5km way and return, ~250m climb) and spectacular panoramic views up to 2860m high. An alternative poor wheather option will be planned.
