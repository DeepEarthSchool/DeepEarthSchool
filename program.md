<b> 10 years of seismological imaging in the Alps: from seismograms to geological interpretation </b>
</p>

Several temporary seismological experiments in the Alps (2012-2020) have provided a data set of unique spatial density and quality for a mountain range. They have advanced our knowledge of the lithospheric structure by combining different seismological imaging methods. The idea was to compare the various images to better understand their limits and better constrain interpretative geological models.

<b> Valérie Ciarletti: Planets, Moons and small bodies: What lies beneath the surface ? What  does it tell us? 
 </b>
</p>

In planetary science, the access to the subsurface of bodies such as planets, moons, asteroids, comets allows to collect first-hand information, which is essential to properly document the current environment of these objects, reveal the processes that shaped them at different stages of their evolution and ultimately provide clues and constraints on the scenarios of formation of our solar system. 
A number of questions are still looking for answers or clues, sounding radars and ground penetrating radars can provide: Are there reservoirs of liquid water in the Martian deep subsurface?  Could lava tubes on the Moon be used as shelters in the frame of human exploration? How much water is trapped as ice in permanently shadowed craters on the Moon ? What is the internal structure of a comet nucleus?  What is the depth of the anticipated oceans beneath the icy shells of Ganymede and Europa ? What are the depths of hydrocarbon sees on Titan? What is the chronology of the geological processes that took place in a given site on Mars or on the Moon?

<b> Paul Cupillard: Characterizing earthquakes from seismic data
 </b>
</p>

We will see how Mathematics and Physics allow describing earthquakes in a quantitative way. Fundamental parameters such as moment tensor and magnitude will be introduced. The way these parameters act on seismic records will be studied as well. From there, various methods for characterizing earthquakes will be presented, including basic ones (based on first arrivals) and more advanced ones (based full waveforms).
